# Introduction

Decisions made during the final moments of a game often determine the outcome â€” a recurring theme present in almost all sports. In the National Basketball Association (NBA), this is especially salient, where many games are decided by the last possession, and a single decision can determine a win or a loss. It is evident that fouling significantly impacts the result of a basketball game, in more ways than one, but is especially important at the end of games. A controversial endgame strategy endorsed by many is to deliberately foul the opposing team when leading by 3 points near the end of the game. The rationale behind this tactic is to force the opponent to earn points from free throws, limiting them to a maximum of 2 and preventing a game-tying three-point shot attempt. This approach not only maintains the lead for the fouling team but also grants them possession with time remaining on the clock.

Our project aims to explore the following questions: 

1. Is fouling when up by 3 points late in an NBA game an effective strategy? 
2. Can we predict the outcome of games based on this late-game fouling strategy? 

To understand end-game strategies such as this one, enhance team performance, and ultimately improve game outcomes, we were interested in understanding how late-game fouls impact the result of an NBA game. We found that [add key findings]. This analysis aims to help coaches, players, and analysts make more informed decisions during late-game situations by providing data-driven insights into the effects of fouling strategies. Moreover, our work lays a foundation for further analysis and research into end-game strategies in basketball.

# Data

NBA play-by-play and box score data was scraped from the [hoopR](https://hoopr.sportsdataverse.org/) package for seasons from 2003 to 2023. The data was filtered to capture late-game scenarios, specifically regular season and postseason games where the game clock was within 24 seconds and the score difference was exactly 3 points in the fourth quarter or any overtimes. A binary variable, `foul`, was created to flag instances of teams fouling in these critical moments. The outcome of each game was determined, and an indicator variable `success` was added to denote whether the leading team ultimately won the game. Game-level statistics such as field goal percentage, three-point percentage, and free throw percentage served as a proxy for team strength. 

The descriptions for the all of the key variables of interest are as follows:

<div style="text-align: center;">

| Variable | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `game_id` |	Unique game ID |
| `season` | NBA season (year) |
| `foul` |  Whether or not the leading team fouled (1 = yes)	|
| `qtr` |	Game period (4 = 4th quarter, 5 = OT1, 6 = OT2, etc) |
| `leading_team` | Team up by 3 points |
| `winner` | Team that won the game |
| `success` | Whether or not the leading team won the game (1 = yes) |
| `home_team_id` | Unique home team identification number |
| `away_team_id` | Unique away team identification number |
| `leading_fgpct` | Field goal percentage of the leading team in the game |
| `opponent_fgpct` | Field goal percentage of the opponent team in the game |
| `leading_3pct` | Three-point percentage of the leading team in the game |
| `opponent_3pct` | Three-point percentage of the opponent team in the game |
| `leading_FTpct` | Free throw percentage of the leading team in the game |
| `opponent_FTpct` | Free throw percentage of the opponent team in the game |
| `clock_seconds` | Seconds left until the end of the period |
